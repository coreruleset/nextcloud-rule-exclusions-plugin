# OWASP CRS - Nextcloud Rule Exclusions Plugin

![Integration tests](https://github.com/coreruleset/nextcloud-rule-exclusions-plugin/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

This plugin contains rule exclusions for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), a productivity platform and file hosting service. These rule exclusions are designed to resolve common false positives and allow for easier integration with the OWASP CRS (CRS).

## Supported apps

Due to how feature rich Nextcloud is, not all apps in Nextcloud can be supported (Especially 3rd party apps). False positives that are due to unsupported apps within Nextcloud must be resolved by a [custom rule exclusion](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/false_positives_tuning/).

Additional apps may be supported if there is enough demand from the community, but in general, support for apps made by 3rd parties (not Nextcloud) won't be added.

## Installation

For full and up to date instructions for the different available plugin installation methods, refer to [How to Install a Plugin](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/plugins/#how-to-install-a-plugin) in the official CRS documentation.

### Conditionally enable plugins for multi-application environments

For full and up to date instructions on how to conditionally enable/disable this plugin on a multisite environment, please refer to [Conditionally enable plugins for multi-application environments](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/plugins/#conditionally-enable-plugins-for-multi-application-environments) in the official CRS documentation.

## Increasing max upload size

Large uploads can be modified with SecRequestBodyLimit. Or they can be more controlled by using the following:

```
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@endsWith /index.php/apps/files/ajax/upload.php" \
    "id:9508610,\
    phase:1,\
    t:none,\
    nolog,\
    ctl:requestBodyLimit=1073741824"
```

ctl:requestBodyLimit is not supported in libmodsecurity3, Nginx users can increase max upload size
by using the following:

```
location /index.php/apps/files/ajax/upload.php { modsecurity_rules 'SecRequestBodyLimit 1073741824'; }
```

Apache libmodsecurity3 Example:
```
 <location "/index.php/apps/files/ajax/upload.php">
    modsecurity_rules 'SecRequestBodyLimit 1073741824'
</location>
```

## Relaxing file upload restrictions

To relax upload restrictions for only the php files that need it, you put something like this in crs-setup.conf:

```
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@rx /(?:remote\.php|index\.php)/" \
    "id:9508600,\
    phase:2,\
    t:none,\
    nolog,\
    pass,\
    setvar:'tx.restricted_extensions=.bak/ .config/ .conf/'"
```

## Increasing max request body size

The Nextcloud desktop client occasionally sends large request bodies not containing any uploaded files.
ModSecurity will block request bodies larger than 131KB, adjusting SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit to 141KB works for all scenarios tested.

Nginx libmodsecurity3 Example:
```
location /remote.php/dav/files/ { modsecurity_rules 'SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit 144384'; }
```

Apache modsecurity2 Example:
```
<location "/remote.php/dav/files/">
   SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit 144384
</location>
```

Apache libmodsecurity3 Example:
```
<location "/remote.php/dav/files/">
   modsecurity_rules 'SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit 144384'
</location>
```

## Testing

After the plugin is enabled, Nextcloud should work without problems caused by CRS (for example, false positives while blocking requests). If problems still occur then please file a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/coreruleset/nextcloud-rule-exclusions-plugin). (Note that high paranoia level deployments may require additional tuning beyond this plugin.)
