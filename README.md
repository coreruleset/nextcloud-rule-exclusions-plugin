# OWASP CRS - Nextcloud Rule Exclusions Plugin

![Integration tests](https://github.com/coreruleset/nextcloud-rule-exclusions-plugin/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

This plugin contains rule exclusions for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), a productivity platform and file hosting service. These rule exclusions are designed to resolve common false positives and allow for easier integration with the OWASP CRS (CRS).

## Supported apps

Due to how feature rich Nextcloud is, not all apps in Nextcloud can be supported (Especially 3rd party apps). False positives that are due to unsupported apps within Nextcloud must be resolved by a [custom rule exclusion](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/false_positives_tuning/).

Additional apps may be supported if there is enough demand from the community, but in general, support for apps made by 3rd parties (not Nextcloud) won't be added.

## Tested Versions

Nextcloud frequently releases new major versions with breaking changes and features that are likely to cause false positives that haven't been discovered/resolved. It's recommended to wait until new feature releases have been tested before upgrading to prevent functionality from being impaired by the plugin. If you do upgrade and encounter issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/coreruleset/nextcloud-rule-exclusions-plugin/issues/new) or [PR](https://github.com/coreruleset/nextcloud-rule-exclusions-plugin/compare).

## Installation

For full and up to date instructions for the different available plugin installation methods, refer to [How to Install a Plugin](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/plugins/#how-to-install-a-plugin) in the official CRS documentation.

### Conditionally enable plugins for multi-application environments

For full and up to date instructions on how to conditionally enable/disable this plugin on a multisite environment, please refer to [Conditionally enable plugins for multi-application environments](https://coreruleset.org/docs/concepts/plugins/#conditionally-enable-plugins-for-multi-application-environments) in the official CRS documentation.

## Known Limitations

Due to some engine limitations, there are a few issues that can't be handled out of the box with this plugin (such as issues relating to uploading large file sizes).
Below you can find a list of known limitations along with workarounds for this issue.

### Increasing max upload size

ModSecurity has very strict defaults on the size of file uploads (13MB), which is often too small even for photos.
It's strongly recommended to increase the max upload size to a value like 10GB by adjusting both `SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit` and `SecRequestBodyLimit` (Defined in bytes).

The process of increasing the value is slightly different depending on your web server, see below for some examples.

**NOTE:** SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit changes the max size for the request body, and not the max file upload size. Due to how Nextcloud iOS uploads files ModSecurity does not recognize it as a file upload.

Apache with ModSecurity2:
```
<LocationMatch "(?:/index\.php/apps/files/ajax/upload\.php|/remote\.php/dav/(?:bulk|files/|uploads/))">
    SecRequestBodyLimit 10737418240
    SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit 10737418240
</LocationMatch>
```

nginx with libModSecurity3:

```
location ~ (?:/index\.php/apps/files/ajax/upload\.php|/remote\.php/dav/(?:bulk|files/|uploads/)) { 
    modsecurity_rules 'SecRequestBodyLimit 10737418240
    SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit 10737418240'; 
}
```

Apache with libmodsecurity3:
```
<LocationMatch "(?:/index\.php/apps/files/ajax/upload\.php|/remote\.php/dav/(?:bulk|files/|uploads/))">
    modsecurity_rules 'SecRequestBodyLimit 10737418240
    SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit 10737418240';
</LocationMatch>
```

### Fixing file uploads on iOS

The Nextcloud iOS app does not set the correct content type when uploading files, which causes issues with ModSecurity as it relies on the content type to correctly parse data.
There's a workaround included with the plugin but it's disabled by default due to a bypass risk, if you use the Nextcloud iOS app then uncomment rule `9508011` in `nextcloud-rule-exclusions-config.conf` to enable the workaround.
The workaround will be removed when this issue is fixed within the iOS app.
See: https://github.com/nextcloud/ios/issues/1942

### Nextcloud Server Crawler

The Nextcloud Server Crawler is used by Nextcloud for various functions of Nextcloud such as generating document previews with Collabora, and testing the functionality of Nextcloud (for example, when setting up the high performance backend for files).
Copy this rule and replace `your-server-ip` with your Nextcloud Server's IP address.
Your Nextcloud Server's IP address will either be your server's WAN IP, or if your server is behind a NAT firewall then it's either your server's private IP address or your default gateway's IP address (Depending on your NAT configuration).
```
# Allow Nextcloud Server Crawler to crawl Nextcloud
# Generating document previews with Collabora
# Sometimes the server crawler's user agent will be missing/empty or an accept header is missing
SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch your-server-ip" \
    "id:9508032,\
    phase:1,\
    pass,\
    t:none,\
    nolog,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveById=920300,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveById=920320,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveById=920330,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById=920120;FILES:data,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById=920121;FILES:data,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById=920120;FILES_NAMES,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById=920121;FILES_NAMES,\
    ctl:ruleRemoveTargetById=922130;MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS"
```

### Coraza default body processor

By default, Coraza will use the `URLENCODED` body processor when no other request body processor has been configured. Which body processor Coraza uses is defined in the `coraza.conf` file. The default behavior is not desirable for Nextcloud since Nextcloud is used to upload files which may include raw binary data or pretty much anything. The following rule can be used to enable the `RAW` body processor when no other parser has been configured.

```
SecRule REQBODY_PROCESSOR "!@rx (?:URLENCODED|MULTIPART|XML|JSON)" \
    "id:9508033,\
    phase:1,\
    pass,\
    nolog,\
    ctl:requestBodyProcessor=RAW"
```

**NOTE:** This issue can also happen if you enable the `enforce body processor` option in `crs-setup.conf` which isn't recommended for Nextcloud.

## Testing

After the plugin is enabled, Nextcloud should work without problems caused by CRS (for example, false positives while blocking requests). If problems still occur then please file a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/coreruleset/nextcloud-rule-exclusions-plugin/issues/new). (Note that high paranoia level deployments may require additional tuning beyond this plugin.)
